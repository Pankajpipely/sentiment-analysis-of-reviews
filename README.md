# sentiment-analysis-of-reviews
This project is a web-based Sentiment Analysis tool built with Streamlit that compares two popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches: VADER and RoBERTa.

🔹 VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that works well for social media text and general-purpose sentiment detection.

🔹 RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) is a transformer-based deep learning model trained on a large corpus of Twitter data (cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment), making it highly effective for context-aware sentiment classification.

The app allows users to enter any text (such as product reviews, tweets, or feedback) and outputs the sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral) in percentages from both VADER and RoBERTa models.
